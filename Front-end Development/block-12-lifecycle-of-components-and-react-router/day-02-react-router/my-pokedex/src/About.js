      <p>
        The Pokédex is a handheld electronic encyclopedia device; one which is
        capable of recording and retaining information of the various Pokémon of
        the world. In order to accomplish Professor Oak's goal of a complete
        Pokémon database, the Pokédex is designed to find and record data on
        each Pokémon the Trainer meets. Pokémon are added to the Pokédex simply
        by encountering them in battle or, sometimes, by seeing a picture of the
        Pokémon. However, detailed entries are not recorded until the player
        catches the Pokémon, receives it as a prize/gift or acquires it in a
        trade.
